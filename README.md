# PhotoPlayground
Play with your photos with several effects: sepia, grayscale, invert, transparent and more!

## Live Demo:

## Info
The app lets you draw images on Canvas and play with them. You can upload an image from your computer or generate a random image from Lorem Picsum. Then you can use some effects:
* Sepia
* Greyscale
* Invert
* RGB -> RBG
* RGB -> BGR
* RGB -> GBR
* RGB -> GRB
* Transparent

## I have used such tools/services/frameworks:
* [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/) - for styling buttons 
* [LoremPicsum](https://picsum.photos/) - for generate random images

## Inspiration
This project is inspired by the Javascript Fun Series: Build a Photo Editor App by Chris Dixon
